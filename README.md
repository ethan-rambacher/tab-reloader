# tab-reloader: Auto-reloader of Chrome tabs

Have you ever sat there refreshing a page every few minutes to see if your package had any shipping updates, or to see if pre-orders had opened, or to see if you had any new messages? NO LONGER!

This is a Chrome extension that periodically refreshes tabs at an interval, so you don't have to. In the future, I hope to add functionality that checks to see if something on the page has changed and creates a notification if it does, so that not only do you not have to keep manually pressing the refresh button - you also don't have to sit and watch the browser window.
